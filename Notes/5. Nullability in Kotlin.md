# Nullable Variables in Kotlin

In Kotlin, you can use nullable variables to represent cases where a variable may or may not have a value. Here are the main points:

1. **What is Null?**
   - Null represents the absence of a value.
   - When declaring a variable, you can assign it a null value to indicate that there's no associated value.
   - For example:
     ```kotlin
     val favoriteActor: String? = null
     ```

2. **Non-Nullable vs. Nullable Types:**
   - Non-nullable types (e.g., `String`) cannot hold null values.
   - Nullable types (e.g., `String?`) can hold either a string or null.
   - To declare a nullable variable, add a `?` operator to the end of the type.
   - For example:
     ```kotlin
     var favoriteActor: String? = "Sandra Oh"
     ```

3. **Reassigning Variables with Null:**
   - You can reassign a nullable variable to null.
   - However, non-nullable variables cannot be reassigned to null.
   - Use nullable variables when a value may be absent, and non-nullable variables when a value is always present.

**Handling Nullable Variables in Kotlin**

In Kotlin, handling nullable variables is essential to prevent null reference errors. Here are the main points:

1. **Nullable Variables:**
   - Nullable variables can hold either a value or null.
   - To declare a nullable variable, use the `String?` syntax (with a question mark).

2. **Accessing Properties of Nullable Variables:**
   - When accessing properties or methods of nullable variables, use the `.?` safe call operator.
   - The safe call operator ensures that if the variable is null, the expression evaluates to null rather than causing a runtime error.
   - Example:
     ```kotlin
     var favoriteActor: String? = "Sandra Oh"
     println(favoriteActor?.length)
     ```

3. **Null Safety:**
   - Kotlin enforces null safety to prevent accidental calls on potentially null variables.
   - Always perform null checks explicitly when converting nullable values to non-nullable types.
   - The `?:` Elvis operator can be used to provide a default value if the variable is null.

# Summary

- A variable can be set to null to indicate that it holds no value.
- Non-nullable variables cannot be assigned null.
- Nullable variables can be assigned null.
- To access methods or properties of nullable variables, you need to use `.?` safe-call operators or `!!` not-null assertion operators.
- You can use `if/else` statements with null checks to access nullable variables in non-nullable contexts.
- You can convert a nullable variable to a non-nullable type with `if/else` expressions.
- You can provide a default value for when a nullable variable is null with the `if/else` expression or the `?:` Elvis operator.
