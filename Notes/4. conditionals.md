# Decision-Making and If/Else Statements

- In life, decisions are often based on the situation we face. For example, if the weather is cold, we wear a jacket; if it's warm, we don't.
- Decision-making is also fundamental in programming. You write instructions for how a program should behave in specific situations, allowing it to act or react accordingly.
- In Kotlin, you can use if/else statements to perform different actions based on conditions.

**Boolean Expressions and Comparison Operators:**
- Boolean expressions combine values, variables, and operators to return a boolean value (true or false).
- Comparison operators are used to create boolean expressions. Examples include:
  - `==` (equal to)
  - `<` (less than)
  - `>` (greater than)
  - `<=` (less than or equal to)
  - `>=` (greater than or equal to)
  - `!=` (not equal to)

**Example: Using an If Statement in Kotlin:**
Imagine building a program that tells drivers what to do at a traffic light.
- Focus on the first condition: a red traffic light. At a red light, you stop.
- In Kotlin, express this condition using an if statement:

```kotlin
fun main() {
    val trafficLightColor = "red"
    if (trafficLightColor == "red") {
        println("Stop!")
    }
}
```
# if/else and when as expressions

You learned how to use if/else and when as statements. When you use conditionals as statements, you let each branch execute different actions in the body based on the conditions.

You can also use conditionals as expressions to return different values for each branch of condition. When the body of each branch appears similar, you can use conditional expressions to improve code readability compared to conditional statements.

1. **If/Else Expressions:**
   - An if/else expression allows you to return different values based on conditions.
   - Syntax:
     ```kotlin
     val result = if (condition) {
         // Code for true branch
         value1
     } else {
         // Code for false branch
         value2
     }
     ```
   - Example:
     ```kotlin
     val trafficLightColor = "Red"
     val message = if (trafficLightColor == "Red") "Stop"
                   else if (trafficLightColor == "Yellow") "Slow"
                   else if (trafficLightColor == "Green") "Go"
                   else "Invalid traffic-light color"
     println(message)
     ```

2. **When Expressions:**
   - A when expression is similar to a switch statement in other languages.
   - It allows you to match a value against multiple cases and return a value based on the matched case.
   - Syntax:
     ```kotlin
     val result = when (value) {
         case1 -> value1
         case2, case3 -> value2
         else -> defaultValue
     }
     ```
   - Example:
     ```kotlin
     val trafficLightColor = "Amber"
     val message = when (trafficLightColor) {
         "Red" -> "Stop"
         "Yellow", "Amber" -> "Slow"
         "Green" -> "Go"
         else -> "Invalid traffic-light color"
     }
     println(message)
     ```
# Statement as Expression

All `if-else`, `if-else-if`, and `when` statements are expressions in Kotlin, meaning that based on the condition met, they represent a value. We can then store this value in a variable.

For example, consider the following rank example:

1. Using `when` expression:
   ```kotlin
   var rankLabel = when (rank) {
       1 -> "Winner"
       2 -> "First Runner Up"
       3 -> "Second Runner Up"
       else -> "Participant"
   }
   ```

2. Alternatively, using `if-else-if `expression:
   ```kotlin
    var rankLabel = if (rank == 1) {
        "Winner"
    } else if (rank == 2) {
        "First Runner Up"
    } else if (rank == 3) {
        "Second Runner Up"
    } else {
        "Participant"
    }
   ```

# Summary

In Kotlin, branching can be achieved with `if/else` or `when` conditionals. Here are the main points:

1. **`if/else` Conditionals:**
   - The body of an `if` branch in an `if/else` conditional is executed only when the boolean expression inside the `if` branch condition returns a true value.
   - Subsequent `else if` branches in an `if/else` conditional get executed only when previous `if` or `else if` branches return false values.
   - The final `else` branch in an `if/else` conditional only gets executed when all previous `if` or `else if` branches return false values.

2. **`when` Conditionals:**
   - It's recommended to use the `when` conditional to replace an `if/else` conditional when there are more than two branches.
   - You can write more complex conditions in `when` conditionals using:
     - Comma (`,`) to match multiple cases.
     - Ranges (e.g., `1..10`) to match a range of values.
     - The `is` keyword to check type compatibility.

3. **Conditionals as Statements or Expressions:**
   - Both `if/else` and `when` conditionals can work as either statements or expressions.
   - When used as expressions, they return a value based on the condition met.

Example:
```kotlin
val rank = 2
val rankLabel = when (rank) {
    1 -> "Winner"
    2 -> "First Runner Up"
    3 -> "Second Runner Up"
    else -> "Participant"
}
println(rankLabel)
```
