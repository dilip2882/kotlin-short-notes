# Variables in Kotlin

In computer programming, a variable is a container for a single piece of data. Think of it as a box that holds a value, with a label representing its name. By referencing the variable's name, you can access the value it contains.

## Why Use Variables?

1. **Flexibility**: Storing values in variables allows your code to adapt to different scenarios. Without variables, your program would only work for specific cases.

2. **Efficiency**: Variables act as placeholders, making it easier to reuse code. Imagine writing personalized lettersâ€”instead of creating a separate letter for each person, use a template with placeholders for names, locations, and dates.

3. **Letter Analogy**:
   - Original letter:
     ```
     Dear Lauren,
     It was great meeting you today at the office. I look forward to seeing you on Friday.
     Have a nice day!
     ```
   - Template with placeholders:
     ```
     Dear {name},
     It was great meeting you today at {location}. I look forward to seeing you on {date}.
     Have a nice day!
     ```

## Using Variables in App Development

- **News App Example**:
  - The "Welcome" text, "Latest news for you" heading, and "View more articles" button remain constant.
  - User names and article details change, making variables (e.g., `name`, `article1Name`, `article1Date`) essential.

- **Maps App Example**:
  - Consider a details screen for a location (e.g., Googleplex).
  - Variables store data such as:
    - Name of the location
    - Star rating
    - Number of reviews
    - Whether the user saved/bookmarked the location
    - Address

Change the data stored in these variables, and your maps app becomes flexible enough to display details for other locations too.

# Define and Use Variables

In computer programming, defining and using variables is essential. Let's break it down:

1. **Variable Definition**:
   - To use a variable, you must first define it.
   - Defining a variable involves:
     - Assigning a unique name to it.
     - Specifying its data type (e.g., integer, string, etc.).
     - Optionally providing an initial value.
   - The terms "declare" and "define" are often used interchangeably.
   - Example: Define a variable called `count` to represent the number of unread messages (initial value: 2).

2. **Using Variables**:
   - Once defined, you can use the variable in your program.
   - Simply type the variable name to access its value.
   - The Kotlin compiler replaces the variable name with its value during execution.

3. **Expression and Evaluation**:
   - An expression is a code snippet that evaluates to a value.
   - It can include variables, function calls, and more.
   - In our example, the expression is the `count` variable, which evaluates to 2.

## Example Program

```kotlin
fun main() {
    val count: Int = 2
    println(count)
}
```
# Updating Variables in Kotlin

When an app is running, the value of a variable often needs to be updated. Let's break it down:

1. **Pseudocode Example**:
   - Imagine a shopping app where the user adds items to their cart.
   - Pseudocode:
     ```
     Create an integer variable called cartTotal (initial value: 0).
     User adds a $20 sweater to the cart.
     Update cartTotal to 20 (current cost of items in the cart).
     Print the total cost (cartTotal) to the output.
     ```

2. **Using `val` and `var`**:
   - `val` (read-only):
     - Once assigned, the value cannot be changed.
     - Use when you expect the variable value to remain constant.
   - `var` (mutable):
     - Allows changing the value after assignment.
     - Use when the variable value can change.
   - Recommended: Use `val` whenever possible for immutability.

3. **Example Program**:
   ```kotlin
   fun main() {
       var cartTotal = 0
       cartTotal = 20
       println("Total: $$cartTotal")
   }
   ```

   # Explore Other Data Types in Kotlin

In Kotlin, there are several data types to work with. Let's explore them:

1. **String**:
   - Represents text.
   - Example: `"Hello, World!"`

2. **Int**:
   - Represents integer numbers.
   - Example: `42`

3. **Double**:
   - Represents decimal numbers with double precision.
   - Example: `3.14`

4. **Boolean**:
   - Represents true or false (only two possible values).
   - Example: `true`

## Example Program: Total Trip Length

```kotlin
fun main() {
    val trip1 = 3.20
    val trip2 = 4.10
    val trip3 = 1.72
    val totalTripLength = trip1 + trip2 + trip3
    println("$totalTripLength miles left to destination")
}
```

# Coding Conventions

When writing Kotlin code, follow these conventions:

1. **Variable Names**:
   - Use camel case for variable names (e.g., `myVariableName`).
   - Start variable names with a lowercase letter.
   - Example: `val discount: Double = 0.20`

2. **Space After Colon**:
   - In variable declarations, include a space after the colon when specifying the data type.
   - Example: `val sum: Int = 1 + 2`

3. **Spaces Around Operators**:
   - Add spaces before and after operators (e.g., `=`, `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`).
   - Example: `var pet = "Dog"`

4. **Line Length**:
   - Aim for a maximum of 100 characters per line.
   - Keep code readable without horizontal scrolling.

# Commenting in Your Code

When writing code, comments play an essential role in improving readability and understanding. Here are some guidelines:

1. **Single-Line Comments**:
   - Use `//` to create a single-line comment.
   - Add a space after `//` for clarity.
   - Example: `// This is a comment.`

2. **Inline Comments**:
   - Comments can start in the middle of a line.
   - Example: `height = 1 // Assume the height is 1 to start with`

3. **Multi-Line Comments**:
   - Use `/* ... */` for longer comments.
   - Start with `/*` and end with `*/`.
   - Add an asterisk at the beginning of each new line.
   - Example:
     ```
     /*
      * This is a very long comment that can
      * take up multiple lines.
      */
     ```

4. **Example Program**:
   ```kotlin
   /*
    * This program displays the number of messages
    * in the user's inbox.
    */
   fun main() {
       // Create a variable for the number of unread messages.
       var count = 10
       println("You have $count unread messages.")

       // Decrease the number of messages by 1.
       count--
       println("You have $count unread messages.")
   }
   ```
# Summary

1. **Variables**:
   - A container for a single piece of data.
   - Must be declared before use.
   - Use `val` for read-only (immutable) variables and `var` for mutable variables.
   - Prefer `val` over `var` when possible.

2. **Declaring Variables**:
   - Start with `val` or `var`.
   - Specify variable name, data type, and initial value (optional).
   - Example: `val count: Int = 2`.

3. **Type Inference**:
   - Omit data type if initial value is provided (compiler infers type).
   - Example: `val message = "Hello, World!"`.

4. **Common Data Types**:
   - `Int`: Integer numbers.
   - `String`: Text.
   - `Boolean`: `true` or `false`.
   - `Double`: Decimal numbers with double precision.
   - `Float`: Decimal numbers with single precision.

5. **Updating Variables**:
   - Use `=` to assign a new value to a variable.
   - Only mutable variables (declared with `var`) can be updated.
   - Use increment (`++`) or decrement (`--`) operators for integer variables.

6. **String Concatenation**:
   - Use `+` to concatenate strings.
   - You can also concatenate other data types to strings.
